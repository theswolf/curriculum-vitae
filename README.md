- I mentored a group of 5 people, through a full stack development cycle, we used mainly SpringBoot, JPA, Rest JSON WS for backend and AngularJS for frontend for one of the biggest Italian banking/insurance companies - Intesa SanPaolo.    

- During the last 6 months we also started adding in some component built with ReactJS and ruled by flux-type workflow (ReFlux).    

- When the project will be released in a production environment, the customers who already have a bank account on Intesa SanPaolo can easily choose between loans, mortgages and credit lines offered by the bank, proposed by the software, using notebook, laptop or mobile.    

- Using modern js framework we maintain in front-end JSP pages for templating and data validation.    
For mobile environments we built a brand new mobile site, using AngularJS and the UI of jquery mobile, and specifically for Android we build a native app, all the platforms (mobile and desktop ) use the same backend, speaking with JSON Rest WS.    
- Improved JVM performance and tuning, focusing on GarbageCollector customization and non blocking IO pattern, analyzing JVM performance with VisualVM and GCViewer.    
- We start adopting async framework ( RXJava ) and refactored concurrency on old framework to decrease latency.    
- In the team we used an agile approach of development, using SCRUM methodologies, continuous building and integration and TDD even in front end ( Jasmine ), even in backend ( Spring test, Mockito ).    
From some weeks we start using Cucumber on e2e testing.    
- Development of the deployment process with Maven / Jenkins on distributed servers

- I also maintained and developed new features of the front-end, basically a web application built with Vaadin, a tool that when was released in production, had helped the scientist team to read the data elaborated by the backend. Used full Java specification ( JMS,EJB,JPS ).
